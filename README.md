## Hi, welcome to my Github!
#### You may be interested in looking at a few of my projects to get a feel for my coding style. The main project I've worked on is: <br>
https://github.com/holley2032/team-apple-cider <br>
It's a full-stack app that I worked on with a few other people. It checks Amazon for deals on given products so people can get good deals on things they want.
The app is built on React on the front-end, Python Flask on the back-end, and PostgreSQL as our database.
I handled the authentication and cookies on the back-end and worked on the sign up/login page on the front-end, as well as a few extra pieces here and there.
#### My other two main repos are Budget-Tracker and Game.
Budget-Tracker is a Python program, currently run interactively but ideally in the future as a web app, designed to help people track budgets. <br>
Game is a repo for a board game I'm creating in C#.
