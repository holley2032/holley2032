## Hi, welcome to my Github!
#### You may be interested in looking at a few of my projects to get a feel for my coding style. The main project I've worked on in this repo is: <br>
https://github.com/holley2032/team-apple-cider <br><br>
It's a full-stack app that I worked on with a few other people. It checks Amazon for deals on given products so people can get good deals on things they want.
The app is built on React on the front-end, Python Flask on the back-end, and PostgreSQL as our database.
I handled the authentication and cookies on the back-end and worked on the sign up/login page on the front-end, as well as a few extra pieces here and there.
#### Most of my coding these days focuses on my day job, but I'm working on some other side projects right now, stay tuned for some updates towards the fall of this year (2025).
