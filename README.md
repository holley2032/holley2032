## Hi, welcome to my Github!
#### You may be interested in looking at a few of my projects to get a feel for my coding style. The main project I've worked on is: <br>
https://github.com/holley2032/team-apple-cider <br><br>
It's a full-stack app that I worked on with a few other people. It checks Amazon for deals on given products so people can get good deals on things they want.
The app is built on React on the front-end, Python Flask on the back-end, and PostgreSQL as our database.
I handled the authentication and cookies on the back-end and worked on the sign up/login page on the front-end, as well as a few extra pieces here and there.
#### I'm working on some more projects right now, stay tuned for some updates towards the fall of this year (2025).
